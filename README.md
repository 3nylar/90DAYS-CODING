# 🚀 90 Days of Coding
A momentum-driven, 90-day execution challenge focused on sharpening my engineering toolkit, building real-world mini-projects, and documenting the entire learning arc in public.

## 🌱 What This Repo Is About
This space functions as my personal innovation lab — a transparent log of daily problem-solving, growing technical intuition, and consistent output. Expect rapid iterations, small wins stacked daily, and honest reflections on what’s clicking (and what’s not).

## 🧩 Structure
- **/daily-logs** — Bite-sized summaries of what I learned each day  
- **/projects** — Mini-builds shipped throughout the challenge  
- **/notes** — Architecture breakdowns, debugging insights, and dev best practices  
- **/resources** — Articles, videos, and tools powering the journey  

## 🎯 Goals
- Build discipline through daily coding  
- Strengthen full-stack fundamentals  
- Push beyond tutorial-driven development  
- Create a trackable, portfolio-ready body of work  
- Ship consistently — not perfectly  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (will evolve)
- Languages: JavaScript, Python, etc.  
- Tools: GitHub, VS Code  
- Domains: Algorithms, Web Dev, Systems Thinking  

## 🔥 Why This Matters
This challenge isn’t just about writing code — it’s about compounding growth, staying accountable, and operating with a builder mindset. Future-me will thank present-me for this grind.
