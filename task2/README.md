## 🛠 My Process

### 🧱 Built With

- **Semantic & accessible HTML**
- **CSS custom properties**
- **Flexbox & responsive layout techniques**
- **Vanilla JavaScript for form logic & calculations**
- **Mobile-first workflow**

### 📚 What I Learned

Working through this project helped reinforce:

- How to build clean, modular input components with prefix/suffix spans

- Using :focus-within to create more intuitive input highlight states

- Implementing mortgage amortization formulas using JavaScript

- Structuring UI states: empty, error, and completed results

- Managing DOM visibility without re-rendering whole components

### 🚀 Continued Development

This project is still **under construction**, and I plan to expand on:

- Building more reusable UI components

- Improving accessibility with ARIA attributes

- Writing more scalable JavaScript patterns

- Implementing automated tests for calculation logic
